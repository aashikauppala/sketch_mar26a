 In this lab, I created a repository on GitHub Desktop by using coding merges from Arduino IDE and Microsoft Visual Studio, and having the changes merged to GitHub.com.
 Git provides powerful version control capabilities, allowing you to track changes, revert to previous states, and collaborate efficiently through branching and merging.
 GitHub adds cloud-based collaboration, issue tracking, and team project management, making it easy to share code and contribute to open-source or group projects.
 GitHub Desktop offers a user-friendly graphical interface, lowering the barrier for beginners to use Git and GitHub without relying solely on the command line.
